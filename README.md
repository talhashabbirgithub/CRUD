# CRUD
A simple ASP.NET Core MVC application that demonstrates One-to-Many CRUD operations. The app manages Categories and Products with a SQL Server database. It allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete categories and products, without using Entity Framework or ADO.NET.

You can download this and some changes in your environment, change serverNmae and Database name and create tables that I provide in DB.txt file. As you knwo your severNmae is different from me. Best of LuckðŸ«¡

 I provide Preview how it looks on running application.
